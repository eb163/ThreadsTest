TODO:
----------------------------------
1. Modify program structure
	-threads should perform "atomic" actions
		-currently threads handle computation AND printing results to screen
		-this results in the display being messed up when a thread pauses in the middle of printing and the other thread strts printing instead
		-have the main thread handle printing results, and computation is handled only by sub threads.
